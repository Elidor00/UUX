# Millimeter range

Standard clothes sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, or 38-40-42-44-46-48-50) etc. create a very limited variety of clothes
for an extremely larger variety of shapes of the human body.
The human body has a large number of individual parts that are simply not considered by the size scheme:
width of shoulder, length of arms, different size of hips and torso, etc.
Add to that: overall shape of the item, choice of fabric, color and print, and any of a large number of details
and accessories: buttons, monograms, logos, etc.
Be creative, be inventive, not just a mere editor of clothes, but a helping tool.
